    <hr>

    <section>
        <h2>"Personal Information" (First Step)</h2>
        <p>
This is the initial step in the "ADD STAFF" form.
 Its primary purpose is to capture the most essential identifying and administrative details for a new staff member.<br></p>

        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p> To collect core personal and HR information.<br></p>
<h3>Key Sections:</h3>
<p>Staff ID: A unique number (10133 is pre-filled as an example)<br>
  Basic Bio-Data: Mandatory fields for the employee's Last Name, First Name, and Gender.<br>
  Contact & Department: A mandatory Mobile Number field and a dropdown to select the employee's Department.<br></p>

  <h3>Functionality:</h3>
  <p>This tab is likely part of a multi-step form, as indicated by the tabs at the top ("Personal Info," "Education & Contact Info," etc.).
     The user focuses on this specific set of data before moving to the next step.
      It also includes an option to upload a profile photo either from a file or directly from a camera.</p>

    </section>


      <section>
        <h2>"Education & Contact Info" (Second Step)</h2>
        <p>
This appears to be the second step or a detailed view of the form focused on the staff member's
 professional qualifications and additional contact details.<br></p>

        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p> To gather detailed information about the employee's background, employment terms, and how to contact them.<br></p>
<h3>Key Sections:</h3>
<p>Employment Details: Fields for Date Employed and Designation/Position.<br>
  Personal Details: Fields for Date of Birth and Marital Status.<br>
  Education: Fields for Qualifications and Education Level.<br>
Contact: Fields for Email Address and Postal Address.<br>
Document Upload: A specific button to Upload Certificate, likely for verifying academic or professional qualifications.<br.</p>

  <h3>Functionality:</h3>
  <p>This tab consolidates all the necessary information for official records and communication.
     The Submit and Cancel buttons at the bottom suggest this might be the final step or a summary page where the user can review all entered data before completing the process</p>

    </section>


       <section>
        <h2>"Class & Subject" (Third Step)</h2>
        <p>This step is highly specific to an educational context (like a school).
           It is designed to assign a teaching staff member to their specific classes and subjects.<br></p>

        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>To define the teaching responsibilities of the staff member.<br></p>
<h3>Key Sections:</h3>
<p>Assignment Selection: A dropdown to choose a Class and a list of Subjects with a "Select All" option.<br>
Assignment Summary Table: A table (currently empty) titled "Classes & Subject Taught" is designed to list all assigned classes and subjects.
 Each entry will likely have a REMOVE button for easy management.<br></p>

  <h3>Functionality:</h3>
  <p>This tab allows an administrator to precisely configure what a teacher will teach.
     The interface suggests that multiple class-subject combinations can be added for a single staff member.</p>

    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>"Other Staff Information" (Fourth Step)</h2>
        <p>The fourth step in the form, titled "Other Staff Information," serves as a comprehensive section for capturing
           any remaining administrative data required to complete the staff profile.
           This part of the form is structured with a series of dropdown menus, each generically labeled "Choose,"
            indicating that the specific selection options are configured within the system's backend settings.
            These menus are likely designed to gather a variety of additional details that are essential for internal records
             but do not fit into the previous categories, such as emergency contact information, bank account details for payroll,
              specific tax status, health insurance options, or employment type classification.<br><br>

By consolidating these miscellaneous fields into a single, dedicated step, the form maintains a clean and organized structure,
 preventing the earlier sections from becoming cluttered.
 This approach ensures that all necessary information is collected in a systematic manner while allowing for flexibility,
  as the dropdown options can be customized to meet the organization's specific administrative and compliance needs.</p>
