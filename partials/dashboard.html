                            This section of the dashboard displays key summary information.<br> 
                            This includes the total number of students currently enrolled, the number of new admissions, and a breakdown of fee collections.<br>
                            It shows how much money has been received today, this month, and over the current term, as well as how much is still expected.<br>
